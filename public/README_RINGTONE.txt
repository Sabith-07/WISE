The fake call feature requires a ringtone file named 'ringtonenew.mp3' in this directory.

To fix the missing ringtone error:

1. Add a ringtone file named 'ringtonenew.mp3' to this directory
2. The file should be:
   - An MP3 format audio file
   - A standard ringtone sound (phone ringing)
   - Around 3-5 seconds in length
   - Suitable for looping

You can obtain a suitable ringtone file from:
- Your device's default ringtones
- Free sound effect websites (ensure it's royalty-free)
- Create your own using audio software

Once you add the ringtone file, the fake call feature will work properly.
